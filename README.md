Cd to the root directory of this project then 
### run ` npm install` to install required packages 
### run ` npm start`  to start the development server

open another terminal then
### run ` npx cypress run or npx cypress open`  to run the tests


### NB I did an update to run the tests on port 3000. I realised that with the previous port 3001 tests  were failing.
